We will need:

* a projector;
* pens and A4 paper;
* some big sheets of A1 paper (flip chart size).

Attendees will need:

* their laptop and power supply;
* an externally accessible WordPress site that they can work on. Either:
    * a staging server (don't hack on a live site! :D) or;
    * a local server (we can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make it externally accessible).
* internet access.
