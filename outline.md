        * WPT, PSI
    * examples of good and bad
    * what are WordPress-specific things

* Benchmark ([PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/), [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) at the start of the workshop
* Focus on one or two things that will really help increase performance
   * concatenating files and image optimization? Concat because it can be tricky and potentially the most useful once peeps know about it and how to do it. Images because it's fairly easy and peeps can easily slip that into their FED workflow once they realise how much of an impact it can make.
* Benchmark again at the end
