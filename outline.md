Just one hour!

* what is good FED perf?
    * how to measure.
        * WPT, PSI
    * examples of good and bad
    * what are WordPress-specific things
* fix yo stuff / make more perfy
* how to make good perf sustainable

---

* Benchmark ([PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/), [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) at the start of the workshop
* Focus on one or two things that will really help increase performance
   * concatenating files and image optimization? Concat because it can be tricky and potentially the most useful once peeps know about it and how to do it. Images because it's fairly easy and peeps can easily slip that into their FED workflow once they realise how much of an impact it can make.
* Benchmark again at the end
