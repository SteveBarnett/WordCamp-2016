## Yo, my outline just to be sure we're on the same page. Times sitting on 60min EXACTLY!

*5m   How do fast sites make people feel?

*5m   Wall Walk (activity):              
      What can we do?  
      What are some changes that will have a big impact to performance? 

*10m  Wall walk summary:             
      Summarize points
      add any glaring omissions 
      put up pitfalls for all sections, talk them through 

*5m   How to measure (demo): 
      PSI: What is it, what does it do?
      Show bad result screen, talk through points one by one. 

*5m   Concrete practice (activity):        
      run test, note your score and put a sticker on wall 
      How did you do? Are you surprised by the score you got?
