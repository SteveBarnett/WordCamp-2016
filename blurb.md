This workshop is for WordPress Theme developers who are interested in improving the User Experience of their Themes.

We’ll start by reviewing why the Front-end performance of Themes (or any web site) is important, and what special considerations we have for a South African market. Then we’ll look at what indicators of good performance are, what tools we can use to help us, and make a checklist that we can use for reviewing sites.

We’ll use these ideas to look at a few off-the-shelf Themes as examples, and see where they might be able to improve on their Front-end performance. We’ll spend the second half of the workshop working on our own projects making them lighter, faster, and better for our users.
