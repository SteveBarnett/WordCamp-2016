## Images

- Optimise your images and use as few as possible.
- Use the best format for your image: SVGs; JPGs (for photos, images with many colours); PNGs (for images with fewer colours); GIFs (for animations).
- Use the `picture` element and `srcset` to provide the image most suitable for the user's device. You can use [Picturefill](http://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/) to enable support for `picture` in browsers that don't support it yet.
